  - High level view of the application and its containers.

# Diagram Tools

## C4

The C4 model consists of hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams providing different levels of detail. The
diagrams are: Context, Container, Component, and Code.

We don't expect to have code diagrams unless you want to capture complex functionality.

Using C4 you can use a tool like [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) to create the diagrams. And export them into the repository.

## Mermaid

Mermaid is a simple and easy to use diagramming tool that can be used to create diagrams in markdown files. It supports
