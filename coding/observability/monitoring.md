# Monitoring

Monitoring is a practice that is very, very important to your application. It's often a forgotten step—until something
goes wrong. You should be monitoring your application in production to ensure that it's working as expected and
delivering the best possible experience to your users.

You should be monitoring things like response times, error rates, and resource usage. You should also be monitoring your
infrastructure to ensure that it can handle the amount of traffic that the application is serving. In some cases, you
might find out that your environment has too many resources allocated, allowing you to optimize and reduce costs.

There are many tools available to help you with monitoring, including:

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

## Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring

I've recently started using Grafana Cloud for my application's uptime monitoring. Grafana Cloud provides a suite of
tools for observability, but for uptime monitoring specifically, they offer **Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring**. This
tool allows you to continuously test your application from multiple locations worldwide, ensuring that it remains
available and performs well for your users.

### Key Features of Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring

#### **1. Global Monitoring**

One of the biggest advantages of using Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring is that it allows you to monitor your
application from multiple geographic locations. This helps ensure that users from different regions experience
consistent performance and availability.

#### **2. Uptime and Performance Monitoring**

You can set up **HTTP checks** to verify that your application is online and responding within acceptable time limits.
If response times increase, Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring can alert you before users start experiencing major
slowdowns.

#### **3. Alerting and Incident Response**

You can configure alerts to notify you when your application goes down or when it performs slower than expected. Alerts
can be sent via multiple channels, including Slack, email, and webhooks, so you can respond quickly.

#### **4. SSL and Domain Monitoring**

A commonly overlooked aspect of application uptime is SSL certificate and domain expiry. Grafana Cloud Synthetic
Monitoring allows you to monitor SSL certificates and domain expiration dates, ensuring that your website doesn’t go
down unexpectedly due to an expired certificate.

#### **5. API Monitoring**

Apart from simple HTTP checks, you can also monitor API endpoints by sending requests with custom headers and checking
response times, status codes, and response bodies. This is useful for applications that depend on third-party services
or microservices.

#### **6. Flexible Check Intervals**

You can configure how frequently your checks run, from every few seconds to several minutes, depending on your needs.
More frequent checks provide faster insights but consume more storage and processing resources.

## Real-World Example: Using Synthetic Monitoring for a Laravel Application

To give you a practical example, I use Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring to track the uptime of my Laravel
applications. Here’s how I set it up:

1. **Set up an HTTP check** – I configured a simple HTTP check that pings my application's health endpoint every 30
   seconds.
2. **Configure alerts** – I set up alerts to notify me on Slack when the response time exceeds 500ms or if the
   application goes down.
3. **Monitor SSL expiration** – I added SSL monitoring to ensure that my certificates are always valid.

This setup has helped me catch issues before users report them, improving uptime and reliability.

If you're looking for an easy-to-use, cost-effective solution for uptime monitoring, Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring
is a great choice.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Synthetic Monitoring

If you want to set up synthetic monitoring in **Grafana Cloud**, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for Grafana Cloud** – [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) offers a free tier with
   synthetic monitoring included.
2. **Create a new Synthetic Monitoring check** – Choose an endpoint to monitor and configure the check settings.
3. **Set up alerting** – Connect alert channels like Slack or email to receive notifications.
4. **Analyze performance data** – Use Grafana dashboards to visualize trends and identify issues before they impact
   users.

## Integrating Synthetic Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana Dashboards

If you're already using **Prometheus**, you can integrate **Synthetic Monitoring** data into your Grafana dashboards for
a unified monitoring solution. Here's how:

1. **Enable Prometheus metrics export** in Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring.
2. **Add Prometheus as a data source** in your Grafana instance.
3. **Create a new dashboard** to visualize uptime, response times, and alert history.

This allows you to correlate synthetic monitoring data with infrastructure metrics, giving you a complete picture of
your application's health.

## Final Thoughts

Monitoring is a crucial part of running a stable and reliable application. Without proper monitoring, you might not
realize an issue exists until your users start reporting problems. Tools like **Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring**
provide a powerful, cost-effective way to ensure that your application remains available, performant, and secure.

If you're not already monitoring your application, now is the time to start!
