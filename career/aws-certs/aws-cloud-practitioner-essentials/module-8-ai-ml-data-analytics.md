# Module 8: AI/ML and Data Analytics

AWS AI can be used to analyze data, automate processes, and enhance decision-making across various industries. Key services include:

- Amazon SageMaker
- AWS Deep Learning AMIs
- AWS DeepLens
- Amazon Rekognition
- Amazon Comprehend
- Amazon Lex
- Amazon Polly

These services enable developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and efficiently.

AI is the development of intelligent computer systems capable of performing human like tasks.

Machine learning is a type of AI for training machines to perform complex tasks.
Machine learning is used to find patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns.

- ML framework is a software library designed to facilitate the development and training of machine learning models.
- Examples include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet.
- AWS ML infrastructure includes services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda to support machine learning workloads.

## Generative AI on AWS

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where models are trained using layers of artificial neural networks. These models can generate new content, such as images, text, and music, by learning from existing data.

Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by large ML models. These can be adapted to perform
multiple tasks.

- Amazon Sagemaker JumpStart - A collection of pre-built models and solutions to help you get started with generative AI quickly.
- Amazon Bedrock - A fully managed service that makes it easy to build and scale generative AI applications.
- Amazon Q - Interactive assistant that can integrate with company's information repositories

## Introduction to Data Analytics on AWS

ETL data pipelines are used in ingest data into a centralised location for analysis and reporting. AWS offers a range of services to support data analytics, including:

- Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming and analytics
- Amazon Data Firehose for loading streaming data into data lakes, warehouses, and analytics services
- AWS Glue for data preparation/processing and ETL
- Amazon Redshift for data warehousing
- Amazon QuickSight for business intelligence and data visualization
- Amazon EMR for big data processing and analytics
- Amazon OpenSearch Service for search and analytics
- Amazon Athena for interactive query service using SQL queries

These services enable organizations to gain insights from their data and make data-driven decisions.

Data pipelines will automate the process of collecting, processing, and analyzing data, allowing organizations to focus on deriving insights and making informed decisions.

Amazon Data Firehose can invoke a Lambda function to transform the data before loading it into the destination.
