# What Are Commands?

Commands are user-invocable shortcuts (typically invoked with / syntax like /commit or /review-pr) that provide streamlined workflows for specific operations. Commands are stored in a dedicated commands folder and offer optimized execution paths for common tasks.

Examples of available commands include:

- /commit - Create git commits with proper formatting and messaging
- /review-pr - Analyze and review pull requests
- /briefing - Generate daily briefings with tasks and calendar events
- twitter commands - Create and manage Twitter content
- task commands - Manage your task system
- notes commands - Add notes to your life OS system
