# What Are Claude models?

Claude models are the underlying AI language models that power Claude Code and Claude.ai.
They range from smaller, faster models optimized for quick responses to larger, more capable models designed for complex reasoning and code analysis.

The main models available are:

- Claude Haiku - The smallest and fastest model, ideal for simple tasks and quick responses with minimal latency
- Claude Sonnet - A mid-size model offering a balance between speed and capability
- Claude Opus - The largest and most capable model, best for complex reasoning, deep code analysis, and multi-step problem solving

When using Claude Code or agents, you can often specify which model to use. Smaller models like Haiku are more cost-effective and faster for straightforward tasks, while Opus provides superior capability for complex work where reasoning quality matters most.
