# What Are Claude Skills?

Claude skills are capabilities and tools that agents can access to accomplish their work. They're part of the agent framework and enable agents to perform specialized operations within their domain.

Skills available to agents include:
- File and code manipulation
- Terminal execution
- Testing and validation
- Web fetching and searching
- Code analysis and exploration
- Debugging and diagnostics

Rather than being user-invoked directly, skills are automatically used by agents as needed to complete assigned tasks. When you dispatch an agent to accomplish something, it determines which skills are appropriate and uses them autonomously.
